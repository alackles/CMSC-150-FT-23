The warm-up problem for the day is Exercise 2 at the end of Chapter 9, where we fill out a table of how different types work together.

We are working through sections 9.8 and 9.9 of the [Think Java](https://greenteapress.com/thinkjava7/thinkjava2.pdf) textbook together as an individual class exercise. If you miss, please work through those sections on your own!
