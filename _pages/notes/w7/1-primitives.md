# Warm-Up Problem

Write a method called `arrayPrint()` which takes in an array as a parameter and prints the full array on one line with brackets and commas. For example, given the array `int[] myArray = {1, 3, 4, 2}`, `arrayPrint(myArray)` should display `[1, 3, 4, 2]`.

# Topics

- Demo: How to do the unicode shift problem from the problem set
- Primitives (`int`, `double`) vs. Objects (`Integer`, `Double`)
- Conversion between primitives and objects
  - int to double vs. int to String
  - int to String vs Integer to String

# Demo Problem

Write a method called `unicode_shift()` which takes a string `word` as a parameter and an integer `shift` and adds `shift` to each character of the string, then returns the new string. For example, unicode_shift("cat", 2) should return `ecv`.
