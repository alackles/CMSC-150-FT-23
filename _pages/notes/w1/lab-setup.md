The purpose of lab is to install the necessary software for the rest of the course. 

**This is an in-person lab.** If you miss lab, you should meet with me to make it up. Historically, I have provided written directions for this lab, and historically, students who try to do it on their own have not been successful.

We will be downloading the following software:

- [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (**Windows only**)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (**Mac only**)
