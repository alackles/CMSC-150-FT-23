You have two options for exploratory exercises for this workday.

## Option 1: Learn Your Terminal

The terminal is a poweful way to interact with your computer.... once you get used to it. 

To start getting used to it, follow [this tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) as far as you can. I know it says it's for Ubuntu, but all the things they do here _should_ work for Mac as well. 

**If you are running Windows, make sure you open WSL, not the Command Prompt.**

Make sure to READ THE TEXT, not just paste in the commands. This includes the first two sections, which are all text. You are encouraged to take notes!

At the end of class, you'll be asked to turn in an exit card with a question you still have, so keep track of any questions you do have.

## Option 2: NANDGame

If you'd rather get some more practice with binary numbers and working with them as bits and electrical signals instead of abstract concepts, you can do so with the following game!

[NandGame](https://www.nandgame.com/) is a way to understand what is happening in your computer at the circuitry level. It should walk you explicitly through the details of playing the game. It's a fun, interactive way to get a head start on some of the things we'll be talking about throughout the couse.

At the end of class, you'll also be asked to turn in an exit card with questions you have, so keep track of confusions as you go through this tutorial.
