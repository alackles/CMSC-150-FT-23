# CMSC 150 Setup Assignment

> This assignment is half assignment, half tutorial.
>
> Whenever you see indented blocks of text like this, it is an explanation of the following section.
>
> In future homework assignments, these sections won't come with that explanation, but you can always look back to this first setup assignment if you need to remember what each assignment section is all about.

## 🏁 Assignment Goals

> The assignment goals are like your to-do list for the assignment. When you can check every box, you have gotten the most you can out of the assignment.
>
> Goals will come with a _[learning objective](https://alackles.github.io/CMSC-150-FT-23/syllabus/#learning-guideline)_ which is indicated at the end of each goal, so that you know why you are completing this assignment, and so that I make sure all of the assignments are aligned with our goals and vice versa.
>
> Assignment _goals_ are not the same thing as assignment _parameters_, listed below. Think of assignment goals as "what should I _learn from_ this assignment?" and assignment parameters as "what should I _do for_ this assignment?"

## ⏲️ Struggle Time

> The _struggle time_ of an assignment is approximately how long I want you to work on the assignment (or pieces of the assignment) alone _before_ looking for outside help. Help comes in the form of: asking me for guidance, asking classmates for their approach, looking back through class notes, referencing the textbook, or referencing online sources.
>
> If you find yourself struggling for longer than the struggle time, you may have moved past "productive struggle" and into "floundering". This is when you should absolutely start lookng for additional help.
>
> On the other hand, if you are struggling for less than the struggle time _without yet solving the problem_, you may not have allowed your brain to work through all the steps and might be seeking a quick solution to an intentionally complex problem. Keep working until you hit your struggle time, and then feel free to find outside help.
>
> These are guidelines, not hard and fast rules. 

Part I: 30 minutes.

Part II: 15 minutes.

## 📝 Assignment Parameters

> Assignment parameters are essentially the instructions for the assignment. Completing the assignment requires you to read through and fulfill the assignment parameters. 

### Part I: GitHub Classroom

GitHub Classroom is a tool provided by GitHub to integrate _sharing and backup of software_ with _automatic systems for checking student work_ so that you can get immediate feedback on the quantitative side of your assignments (whether your code works) and I can give you detailed feedback on the qualitative side of your assignments (whether you are meeting learning goals). 

Git and GitHub are complex software tools with many, many moving parts. We will learn this software slowly over the term. For now, you only need to closely follow the directions given when you make an account. 

The link to join our course's GitHub Classroom is posted on Canvas. This link cannot be posted publicly because it allows you to link your name to our roster, so I don't want just anybody claiming to be you!

For Part I, the goal is just to have a working classroom account.

To fulfill the parameters, you must:

- [ ] Create an account on GitHub 
- [ ] Link your account to the roster on GitHub Classroom
- [ ] Accept the Setup assignment
- [ ] Figure out how to check this box (HINT: figure out how to edit this file) **(ON GITHUB CLASSROOM)**

### Part II: Visit the Tutoring Room 

Drop-in tutoring for CMSC 150 will take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 PM - 9 PM in Youngchild Hall 121. Other STEM subjects like biology, chemistry, physics, and math will also have tutoring in this same room at similar times; the full schedule will be available soon.

Drop-in tutoring is _free for all students_ and is a great way to get some additional help on an assignment or with understanding a concept. CMSC tutors are fellow students who have taken the class before and can help you succeed!

Often the hardest part of going to tutoring is just clearing the barrier of getting up and going to find the room (this is a real and difficult barrier!). I want to help you cross that barrier here.

To fulfill the parameters of this assignment, you must:

- [ ] Visit Youngchild Hall 121 and take a picture of the room number or room.
- [ ] Upload your photo to your setup assignment repository.

Instructions on uploading a photo are intentionally missing. HINT: look around your assignment repository (repo) to see if you can find a button that will allow you to upload files. 

**Your assignment is complete when all your assignment parameters are met.**
