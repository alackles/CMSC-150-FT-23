The goal for this lab is to **practice making errors** so that they don't scare you when you make them unintentionally.

We'll do this by playing a game called **error bingo**. You'll each get a Bingo card by following the link below. This lists 24 possible errors you could see. 

Your goal is to make a Bingo (5 across, down, or diagonal) by **generating each of these errors on your computer**. Once you generate one, check it off on the bingo board. For repeated values, you have to generate those errors in _different ways_. 

If a single compilation or run generates multiple errors, you can check multiple boxes. 

Once you make a Bingo, as is customary, you shout, "Bingo!" and I'll come around to check on you. I'll ask you to explain what each error is trying to tell you, and then you're done.

**Lab is over when everyone has at least one Bingo.** Once you finish, feel free to help your tablemates or classmates, but **do not** type on their computers!
