Here are 10 exercises of varying difficulty for you to try, **without notes and without your book.** 

For the first 30 minutes of class, we'll work on them silently, individually. After that point, you can talk with your tablemates as much as you like to try to get the problems done. 

At the end of class, you'll fill out an exit card with how many problems you completed on your own, and how many problems you completed with help. 

1. Write a program that prints the string, "Welcome to CMSC 150!"
2. Write a program like #1, but store the course number `150` as a variable, and use that variable in the print statement. 
3. Write a program that sums up two numbers called `x` and `y` (which are set to any value you like) and prints the sum.
4. Write a program like #2, but print the sum to exactly 3 decimal places. 
5. Write a program like #3, but make sure to use `printf` (or `println` if you already used `printf`).
6. Write a program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius (the formula for area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$)
7. Write a program that takes in two integers from the command line and prints them next to each other. For example, if it takes in the integers `8` and `920`, it should print `8920`.
8. Write a program to calculate total price of a collection of items. It should take in a price per item in dollars, an integer quantity, and an item name and displays the total price for that number of items. For example, if the price is `2.0`, the quantity is `7`, and the item is `peaches`, the program should print something like, `7 peaches = $14.00`. **Amounts < $1 should print with zero-padding.**
9. Write a program to calculate someone's birth year based on how old they will be on the lat day of this year. You should take their age from the command line.
10. Write a program to calculate someone's age in days based on their birth date and the current date.
