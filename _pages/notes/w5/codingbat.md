[Sample code for this week.](https://github.com/alackles/CMSC-150-FT-23/tree/main/_pages/notes/w5)

Today, we're completing problems from CodingBat, an online resource for Java programming practice. 

You may complete as many problems as you like, but you must turn in **at least 3 completed problems (1 from each set below)**, and **at least 1 attempted problem that you did not complete (from any set)**. Your attempted problem should include a note about what made it difficult to complete or what you got stuck on.

- **Set 1**: [Warmups](https://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-1)
- **Set 2**: [Boolean Logic](https://codingbat.com/java/Logic-1)
- **Set 3**: [String Manipulation](https://codingbat.com/java/String-1) **note** - make sure to read the hint at the top of this set about how to extract a _substring_. 

Submit your code as separate files for each problem in [this assignment repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/cCW1PuZ6). **Hint:** Clone the assignment repository first, and then create your files in that repository. 

**Try each of the problems for at least 10 minutes before accessing ANY outside resources, including notes or classmates.** 

Get through as many problems as you reasonably can. The requirements above (3 completed problems, 1 attempted) are a _minimum_, i.e., if you can do that within the allotted lab time, you are at least at a C-level understanding of the concepts _at this moment_.

If you are able to do more problems, that would show that your understanding of the material has sunk in and is becoming routine, rather than something you are consciously pulling for. Doing more than the allotted problems would indicate you're likely at a B-level understanding. Doing more and doing them _well_ and _without resources_ would indicate A-level understanding.
